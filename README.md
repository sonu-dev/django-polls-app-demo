Migrations are very powerful and let you change your models over time, as you develop your project, without the need to delete your database or tables and make new ones - it specializes in upgrading your database live, without losing data. Weï¿½ll cover them in more depth in a later part of the tutorial, but for now, remember the three-step guide to making model changes:
